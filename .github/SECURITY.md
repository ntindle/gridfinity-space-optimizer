# Security Policy

## Overview

This is a web application deployed continuously from the main branch. We take security seriously and address vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please do NOT:
- Open a public GitHub issue
- Post on social media
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before we've had a chance to fix it

### Please DO:
- Email us at: [Create a security advisory](https://github.com/ntindle/gridfinity-space-optimizer/security/advisories/new)
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- Include the impact of the issue
- Suggest a fix if you have one

### What to expect:
- **Response Time**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 days
- **Updates**: We'll provide updates at least every 72 days
- **Fix Timeline**: We aim to release a fix within 7-14 days depending on complexity
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure with you

## Security Measures

### Code Security
- All code is scanned using CodeQL and multiple SAST tools
- Dependencies are regularly audited for vulnerabilities
- Automated security checks on all pull requests

### Dependency Management
- Weekly automated dependency audits
- Snyk monitoring for real-time vulnerability detection
- Automated PR creation for security updates

### Build Security
- CI/CD pipelines run in isolated environments
- No secrets stored in code
- Environment variables used for sensitive configuration

## Security Tools in Use

- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security scanner
- **Snyk**: Dependency and container vulnerability scanning
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanner
- **Gitleaks**: Secret detection in git repos
- **TruffleHog**: Credential verification scanner
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency auditing

## Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens
2. **Validate input**: Always validate and sanitize user input
3. **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent injection attacks
4. **Implement proper authentication**: Use secure session management
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update packages
6. **Follow secure coding guidelines**: OWASP Top 10

## Automated Security Checks

Every pull request undergoes:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection scanning
- Code quality and security review
- License compliance checking

## Contact

For security concerns, please use GitHub's security advisory feature or contact the maintainers directly through secure channels.
